## Key Performance Indicators

To follow the progress of the project, multiple KPIs have been defined. They can be viewed through our KPIs spreadsheet.

Our KPIs have been separated into different categories as follows:

### Documents

- Project Charter
- Functional Specifications
- Technical Specifications
- Test Cases
- Test Plan
- Management Artifacts
- User Manual
- README

**Formula:**

<div align="center">

$$\text{Progress} = \frac{\text{Current Number of Completed Sections}}{\text{Total Predefined Sections}} \times 100$$

</div>

### Design

- Mock-ups

You can access the mock-ups following :

[This link](https://app.uizard.io/p/b0852220/overview) for the first part

And[ this link ](https://app.uizard.io/p/a2990ae4/overview) for the second part

**Formula:**

<div align="center">

$$\text{Progress} = \frac{\text{Current Number of Completed Pages}}{\text{Total Predefined Pages}} \times 100$$

</div>

### Development

- Database Creation
- Predefined Styles
- Get Started Page
- Questions Page
- Login Page
- Home Page
- Recommandation system
- Search Page
- Pairing Popups

**Formula:**

<div align="center">

$$\text{Progress} = \frac{(\text{Completed Tasks} + \sum \text{Partial Progress on Ongoing Tasks})}{\text{Total Tasks Planned}} \times 100$$

</div>

### Human Resources

- Unjustified Absence Time
- Overtime

## Risks & Assumptions

| ID | Description | Consequence | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation/Avoidance |
|----|-------------|-------------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Delays in task assignment | Affects productivity and project timelines | High | Medium | Implement a more efficient task management system |
| 2 | Technical learning curve | Some team members may struggle with new tools | Medium | High | Provide additional support and training |
| 3 | Design integration challenges | More time-consuming than expected | Medium | Medium | Allocate more resources to this task |

## Mood

The mood inside the team is calculated based on the different aspects:

- Motivation
- Management
- Productivity
- Communication

This is a simple average of the various categories, taking into account team size, number of responses, and category evaluation.

This average is currently: 7.8 ðŸŒŸ
