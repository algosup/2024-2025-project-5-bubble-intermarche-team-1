# Kick-Off Meeting Summary – "Bubble" PWA for Intermarché Saint-Rémy-de-Provence

On April 25, 2025, a kick-off meeting was held via Microsoft Teams to discuss the "Bubble" Progressive Web App (PWA) project for Intermarché Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. This meeting brought together key members from both the client and project teams to define objectives, expectations, and next steps.

## Objectives and Context

The primary goal of this meeting was to ensure all stakeholders are aligned on the project's vision. The client aims to develop a bilingual PWA, accessible via a QR code at the store entrance, to enhance the shopping experience for foreign tourists in the wine and cheese aisles. This app aims to replicate the expertise of in-store employees and boost wine and cheese sales.

## Attendees

The meeting included several key participants:

- **Client Team:**
  - Celia, Representative of Intermarché Saint-Rémy-de-Provence
  - Franck JEANNIN, Co-founder of ALGOSUP
  - Additional members from Teams 2, 3, and 4

- **Project Team:**
  - Geoffrey DELRIEU, Project Manager
  - Yann-Maël BOUTON, Program Manager
  - Loïc NOGUES, Technical Lead
  - Salaheddine NAMIR, Quality Assurance
  - Alexis SANTOS, Software Engineer
  - Michel RIFF, Technical Writer

## Key Discussion Points

### Client Requirements

The client expressed the need for a simple and effective app that can scan barcodes to provide detailed product information, wine-cheese pairing recommendations, and recipe ideas. The app should also include in-store navigation to help customers locate products.

### Target Audience

The app is primarily aimed at international visitors with high purchasing power and non-resident shoppers who do not require account registration. Store staff will also use the app to update the top-100 best-seller list via a Slack feed.

### Technical Considerations

Bubble.io was discussed as a potential technology for developing the app. An appropriate licensing model will be applied based on the development tools and client needs. The app must be compatible with as many devices and browsers as possible to reach the widest audience.

### Artistic Direction

The client has given the project team creative freedom regarding the app's design and artistic direction, with no strict branding requirements.

### Core Features

Several key features were identified:

- **Barcode/EAN Scanner:** Allow users to scan barcodes to get detailed product information.
- **In-Store Navigation:** Help customers locate products within the store.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Suggest complementary items and allow personalization through basic filters.

### Marketing Strategy

The client requested the project team to propose a marketing strategy to support the app launch. The goal is to maximize user awareness and drive adoption both in-store and online.

## Decisions and Next Steps

It was decided that the project will begin with creating mockups to validate the user experience and ensure features align with client expectations. The team will also familiarize themselves with Bubble.io to ensure technical feasibility.

A feedback session with the client will be scheduled after the delivery of the first set of mockups, planned for May 5, 2025.

## Risks and Open Questions

There is a need to validate if all intended features are achievable with Bubble.io. There is also a risk of scope changes if client expectations are not fully aligned during the mockup approval stage.

## Next Meeting

The next meeting will be scheduled after the client provides feedback on the mockups. The agenda will include reviewing the mockups and finalizing the functional and technical specifications based on the validated scope.
